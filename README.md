# heroic-scale-calculator

A simple browser based app to convert between real world measurements and that of heroic scale minitures. Conversions can be done in either direction, simply by changing the number in the appropriate box (other values will then be recalculated to keep everything in sync).

This is the first thing I've ever written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and was mostly done as a test of Elm.

Compiled code is stored in the "docs" directory so that [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will host it. It's not really "docs" in there. The Makefile in this directory will build this files.
