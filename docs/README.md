# "docs" directory / compuled app for hosting on Github Pages

This isn't really a "docs" directory; it's really contains the compiled and ready to run app.

The Makefile in the directory above will build this files.

The only reason this directory is called "docs" is so that [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will host it.
